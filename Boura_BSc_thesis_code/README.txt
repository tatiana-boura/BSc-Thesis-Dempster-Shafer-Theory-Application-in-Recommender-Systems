In order for the code to be able to run ECLiPSe 6.1, Python 2.7 & 3.10, rpy2, PyCLP should be installed in the machine. 
If you find difficulties in installing the PyCLP please refer to the ANNEX in the Thesis.

The folder 'application_prolog' refers to the Application of DST and use of CLP.

The folder 'prolog_vs_ibelief' refers to the comparison of the two implementations.

In each folder you will find a bash script (.sh) that runs multiple exections of the code.

For the code structure and the functionality of each module, please refer to the Thesis in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively.

The dataset won't be provided here, as it is large, but can be found in : 
1) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tqFFT6QBJaE7qzGn44tnt4Yf5ygiB9ch?usp=sharing   or
2) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vodclickstream/netflix-audience-behaviour-uk-movies

The dataset should be placed inside 'application_prolog' folder and saved with the name 'vodclickstream_uk_movies_03.csv' in order for the code to work.
